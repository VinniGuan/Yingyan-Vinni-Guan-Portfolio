# [R Shiny App-CardiovascularDisease](https://github.com/VinniGuan/CVS-disease-R-Shiny-App-Project)

This R project is for MGMT 590 - Using R for Analytics at Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, developed by team: Jiayu Zhang, Jason Chen, Vinni Guan and Rohit Soans.

We build an app to predict the probability of heart disease in a given individual. This app will be an asset in the hands of sales teams for Health Insurance Companies.  Sales agents can use the app during their sales pitches. On hearing what is the probability that they may get a heart attack, most people are likely to be garner strong interest in Health Insurance products. We found a Cardiovascular dataset on Kaggle with 70,000 observations. We explored and transformed our data and build a model to predict the probability of heart disease.

#### Business Problem
The UnitedHealthcare Consumer Sentiment Survey showed that only 9% of Americans surveyed “showed an understanding” of four basic health insurance terms — health plan premium, health plan deductible, out-of- pocket maximum and co-insurance. Due to the lack of understanding of Insurance Products, most people are less likely to switch their scheme and end up simply renewing their scheme with their current provider, even though those products maybe mispriced or unsuitable. This is one of the key challenges sales teams of health insurance companies face. Hence new customer acquisition in this industry is both difficult and expensive.

#### Analytics Problem
To calculate the predicted probability of heart disease based on key lifestyle indicators such as Age, Height, Weight, Cholesterol, Systolic blood pressure, Diastolic blood pressure, Glucose, Smoking, Alcohol and Physical activity.

#### Data
The dataset consists of 70,000 records of patient’s data in 12 features, such as age, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and etc. The target class "cardio" equals to 1, when patient has cardiovascular disease, and if it is 0, the patient does not have heart disease.
